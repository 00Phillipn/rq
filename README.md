# rq â€” Simple job queues for Python

**rq** is a lightweight Python job queue, based on Redis.


# Putting jobs on queues

To put jobs on queues, first declare a Python function to be called on
a background process:

    def slow_fib(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return slow_fib(n-1) + slow_fib(n-2)

Notice anything?  There's nothing special about a job!  Any Python function can
be put on an RQ queue, as long as the function is in a module that is
accessible from the worker process.

To calculate the 36th Fibonacci number in the background, simply do this:

    from rq import Queue
    from fib import slow_fib
    
    # Calculate the 36th Fibonacci number in the background
    q = Queue()
    q.enqueue(slow_fib, 36)

If you want to put the work on a specific queue, simply specify its name:

    q = Queue('math')
    q.enqueue(slow_fib, 36)

You can use any queue name, so you can quite flexibly distribute work to your
own desire.  Common patterns are to name your queues after priorities (e.g.
`high`, `medium`, `low`).


# Installation

Simply use the following command to install the latest released version:

    pip install rq

If you want the cutting edge version (that may well be broken), use this:

    pip install -e git+git@github.com:nvie/rq.git@master#egg=rq
