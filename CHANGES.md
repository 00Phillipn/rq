### 0.2.0

- `q.enqueue()` accepts instance methods now, too.  Objects will be pickle'd
  along with the instance method, so beware.
- `q.enqueue()` accepts string specification of functions now, too.  Example:
  `q.enqueue("my.math.lib.fibonacci", 5)`.  Useful if the worker and the
  submitter of work don't share code bases.
- Job can be assigned custom attrs and they will be pickle'd along with the
  rest of the job's attrs.  Can be used when writing RQ extensions.
